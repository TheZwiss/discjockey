# Library and sources: how the work is orchestrated

Rules for building `docs/2026-10-23-library-and-sources-design.md` (the spec) with subagents. Goals: the user spends as
little time and as few tokens as possible; no agent runs away; the orchestrator's context stays small. Archived with
the spec when the last stage is merged.

## 1. Roles

| Role | Who | Does | Never |
|------|-----|------|-------|
| **Orchestrator** | The main session | Writes briefs, dispatches, merges, runs the final checks, keeps `docs/issues.md`, memory and this file's progress table, tells the user what they need to know | Read full diffs, whole plans or big source files; write product code |
| **Planner** | Opus, one per stage | Writes the stage's plan (§3) | Write full code; run tests or builds; read outside its read list without counting it |
| **Implementer** | Opus or Sonnet by difficulty (§2), one per task group, in a worktree | Builds one task group with tests, commits on the group's branch | Read the whole plan or the spec; run `npm run verify`; touch a real library |
| **Reviewer** | Sonnet per task group; Opus once per stage | Reviews against the plan's tasks and CLAUDE.md's invariants | Rewrite the code itself |

At most two agents run at the same time.

## 2. Which model

Opus where judgement is needed and a mistake is expensive. Sonnet where the plan has already made the decisions.

- **Opus:** each stage's planner; the database, migration and crash safety; the scanner and content keys; the
  planner rules (option A); tidy-up and undo; a hub page or a sidebar redesign (they may improve the approved design,
  CLAUDE.md §12); the final review of each stage.
- **Sonnet:** wiring a finished engine piece into `api.py` / `jobs.py` / views; contract, `types.ts` and fake-backend
  updates; README and `docs/` updates; a source whose interface the plan fixes (Qobuz, SoundCloud, YouTube Music);
  per-group reviews; re-reviews after a fix round.

When a Sonnet task turns out to need decisions the plan didn't make, it stops and reports. It never guesses.

## 3. Plans

CLAUDE.md "Plans are designs" applies and overrides `superpowers:writing-plans`. On top of it:

- **A plan is researched instructions, not code.** It names, for each task: the files and functions to change
  (`file:function`), the exact interfaces between tasks, the binding values and the user-facing words, the behaviours
  the tests must pin, and the reason for each decision. That "where" is what saves each implementer from exploring
  again. A short snippet is allowed only where the exact form *is* the decision (a schema, a signature, an event shape).
- **300–600 lines.** A planner that needs more splits the stage into two plans and says so.
- **Task groups.** The plan groups its tasks into implementer-sized groups (§5) and marks each group Opus or Sonnet.
  Every group lists its own read list, so its implementer reads only that.
- **Its last section is the stage's checks:** which tests, which screenshots, which live check for the user.

## 4. Briefs

Every brief has the same parts, in this order, and stays under about 60 lines:

1. **One deliverable.** What is done when the agent stops.
2. **Read list.** Exact files and sections, in reading order. Module docstrings and `grep -n "^def \|^class "`
   outlines come before whole files. For tests: `grep -n "def test_"` and the helper signatures, never whole test
   files unless the task changes them.
3. **Read budget and stop rule.** "Beyond the list, at most N more file reads (N = 10 for a planner, 6 for an
   implementer). If you need more, stop and report what is unclear." Planners also stop at the first spec conflict
   and report it, rather than reading on to resolve it.
4. **Don'ts.** No `docs/archive/` (unless a cited reason is needed: search it, don't read it); no `npm run verify`;
   no real library, Spotify, Qobuz or yt-dlp calls; no code in plans; nothing outside the task group.
5. **Checks to run.** While working, only the test files of the code the agent changed (`uv run pytest -q
   tests/test_x.py`, `npx vitest run <file>`, `npm run rules -- --page P --only …`), not after every edit. Once at
   the end of the task group, the full Python suite (`uv run pytest -q | tail -3`, about 25 s in parallel). Never
   `npm run verify` (§6).
6. **Report format.** At most 15 lines, no code, no diffs: what was done, commits (hash + subject), checks run with
   their result, what is left or doubtful, anything added to `docs/issues.md`.

The orchestrator tells the user each job's expected size before sending it (a planner: about 100–150k tokens; an
Opus implementer: up to about 150k; a Sonnet task: 40–100k).

## 5. Sizing and runaway protection

- **A task group fits in one agent:** at most about 8 plan tasks or about 1,500 changed lines, one area of the code.
  Bigger groups are split before dispatch.
- **Fix rounds go to the implementer that wrote the code** (by `SendMessage`) while its context is still small
  (it wrote one group). After a second fix round, or when the fix concerns another area, a fresh Sonnet gets the
  findings plus the files instead. Minors are fixed in the same round; only spec conflicts and user decisions are
  parked.
- **An agent that stops at its budget is not restarted with "keep going".** The orchestrator reads its report, then
  narrows the task or answers the question, and sends a fresh, smaller brief.
- **Two failed rounds on the same problem** go to the user with a short summary and a recommendation.

## 6. Reviews and checks

- **Per task group:** one Sonnet review of the group's diff against its plan tasks and CLAUDE.md's invariants.
  It does not review the whole stage.
- **Per stage, before the merge:** one Opus review of the whole stage branch against the spec's sections for that
  stage.
- **The full Python suite** (about 1,700 tests) runs in parallel by default (pytest-xdist) in about 25 s. Agents run
  it once at the end of their task group, never after each edit, and report only its summary line. CI (`check.yml`)
  runs it again when the orchestrator pushes the stage branch before the merge; the orchestrator reads only the
  result (`gh run list` / `gh run view --log-failed`). A failure goes to a fix round with the failing tests' names.
- **`npm run verify`** isn't in CI (its design rules take 15+ minutes there); the orchestrator runs it once in the
  background, only for stages that change `hub-ui`, and reads only its last lines.
- **Touched tests while working** (§4.5): when a change reaches into a module many tests use (`library.py`, `db.py`,
  `planner.py`, `models.py`), the plan names the test files that cover it, so agents run those while working.
- The orchestrator checks claims cheaply: `git log --oneline`, `git diff --stat`, and the test summaries. It reads
  code only to settle a disagreement between an implementer and a reviewer.

## 7. Branches, merges, releases

- One branch per stage (`feat/library-<stage>`). Each task group works in a worktree off it and is merged back after
  its review.
- The stage branch is pushed for CI before the merge (§6). A stage merges into `main` after its final review and a
  green CI run, and `main` is pushed. Stages 1 and 2 are merged
  together.
- A release (`git tag v…`) is outward-facing: the orchestrator asks the user once per release.

## 8. The orchestrator's context

- It never pulls file contents in when a report or a summary line will do.
- After each stage's merge it updates this file's progress table and its memory, then tells the user it's a good
  moment to `/compact`. Everything needed to go on lives in this file, the plan and memory, so nothing is lost by
  compacting.
- It also suggests `/compact` before a stage's implementation starts when planning took many rounds.

## 9. What the user is asked for

Only:

- product decisions the spec doesn't settle, and spec conflicts a planner finds;
- the stage 5 mockups, before building;
- the live checks: rekordbox after a tidy-up and an undo (stage 2), importing their own library (stage 4);
- a go for each release;
- the AcoustID question (issue 24), after stage 4.

Everything else is decided and done without asking, and reported in one short message per stage.
